## 📝 About the App

**Stay At Eko** is a full-stack web app where users can browse, create, edit, and delete short-term rental listings. Each listing includes a name, location, price, and description.

Users can also book listings by selecting check-in and check-out dates and automatically seeing the total cost.

The app is built with the **MEN stack** (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) and follows full CRUD functionality. It also includes user sign-up/login, session-based authentication, and basic data validation.

### Why I built it

I wanted to build something useful that also helped me get better at backend development, routing, working with databases, and handling user sessions. Stay At Eko was the perfect project to practice full CRUD, authentication, and clean UI—all in one.
