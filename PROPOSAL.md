# Project Proposal: Stay at Eko

## Problem Statement

Finding and sharing short-term rental spaces can be tricky without a centralized platform. ‚ÄúStay at Eko‚Äù solves this by offering a clean, simple way to list and browse affordable stays ‚Äî inspired by Airbnb, but simplified.

## App Overview

Stay at Eko is a web app where users can:
- View all available rental listings
- Add a new listing with name, location, price, description, and optional image
- Edit or delete listings

The app will be built using the MEN stack and follow full CRUD functionality.

## Core Features (MVP)

- Full CRUD for listings:
  - Create: Add a new listing
  - Read: See all listings
  - Update: Edit an existing listing
  - Delete: Remove a listing
- Clean UI for adding/viewing listings
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## Stretch Goals

- User authentication (signup/login)
- Image upload
- Booking system (select dates, show total price)
- Filter by location or price
- Save (favorite) listings

## Technologies

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- HTML /EJS / CSS / JavaScript
